## Questions

    How am I planning to store all this stuff?
    A: Localstorage for now I guess, then figure something else out later.

## Display Components

    build the staff and tab components, and feed different notes in and make sure the display is correct.

    Build the song display component to display the entire song

    Build the List component to display list of saved songs

    build the keyboard component that will show all the tabs/notes and trigger an event when they're clicked.
